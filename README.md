Unity ML-Agents Banana Environment 
</p>

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

* `0` - move forward.
* `1` - move backward.
* `2` - turn left.
* `3` - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Download the Unity Environment

For this project, you will **not** need to install Unity - this is because we have already built the environment for you, and you can download it from one of the links below. You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

* Mac OSX: <a href="https://github.com/TechFinJobs/Project1-Navigation/files/7656840/Banana.app.zip" download>click here</a>
* Windows (32-bit): <a href="https://github.com/TechFinJobs/Project1-Navigation/files/7656839/Banana_Windows_x86.zip" download>click here</a>
* Windows (64-bit): <a href="https://github.com/TechFinJobs/Project1-Navigation/files/7656835/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip" download>click here</a>
 


Then, place the file in a folder in your GitHub repository, and unzip (or decompress) the file.

(For Windows users) Check out this link if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

### Instructions

In order to train an agent, open `Navigation.ipynb` on Jupyter Notebook and run the code by pressing Shift+Enter or clicking Run button.
